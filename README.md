# SystemResourceMonitoring
This is a semester long project for ITEC 315. The goal of this project is to create an application in C# that monitors system resources and also has a database component.

## Setting up
Please check out the [SQL](./sql/) and [Config](./config/) folders for more information. 
These files may be important for those who wish to run a MySQL database with this project.
The project can run without a database.
